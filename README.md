## How to Build JAR file<a name="build"></a>

If you don't want to build download it from [here](https://github.com/heshanthenura/PassMan/releases)

### Make sure [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) is already installed and configured.

- Go to project directory and run
```
gradle jar
```
- Above command will compile your JavaFX application, bundle it with its dependencies, and create an executable JAR file in the build/libs directory.
```
java -jar build/libs/PassMan-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
- That's it! You've successfully built a JavaFX project using Gradle. You can now distribute and run your JavaFX application using the generated JAR file.
