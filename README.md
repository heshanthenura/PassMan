## How to Build the Project <a name="build"></a>
### Make sure [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) is already installed and configured.

- Go to project directory and run
```
mvn clean install
```
- Above command will compile your JavaFX application, bundle it with its dependencies, and create an executable JAR file in the target/ directory.
```
java -jar target/my-javafx-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
- That's it! You've successfully built a JavaFX project using Maven. You can now distribute and run your JavaFX application using the generated JAR file.
